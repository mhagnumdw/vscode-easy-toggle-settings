## Features

Allows you to quickly and easily toggle any VS Code setting directly from the status bar.

You choose which settings to toggle. A button is added to the status bar for each.

Perfect for settings you frequently toggle.

## Installation

Install through VS Code extensions, searching for `Easy Toggle Settings`. Or go to  [Visual Studio Code Market Place: Easy Toggle Settings](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mhagnumdw.easy-toggle-settings).

## Usage

For example, let's say we want to toggle these settings:

- `editor.codeLens` between `true` and `false`
- `editor.renderWhitespace` between `"none"` and `"all"`

Open global settings (`Ctrl Shift P > Open user settings json`) and add at the end:

```json
"easy-toggle-settings.items": [
  {
    "property": "editor.codeLens",
    "icon": "eye",
    "values": [true, false]
  },
  {
    "property": "editor.renderWhitespace",
    "icon": "whitespace",
    "values": ["none", "all"]
  }
]
```

> Icons can be found at [Codicon](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/icons-in-labels#icon-listing)

After saving the settings, the icons will appear in the status bar. Each click will toggle the setting between the declared values.
